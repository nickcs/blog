title: SOLID in JavaScript
---

[SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. The principles, when applied together, intend to make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time.

SOLID is an acronym where:-

* S stands for SRP (Single responsibility principle)
* O stands for OCP (Open closed principle)
* L stands for LSP (Liskov substitution principle)
* I stands for ISP (Interface segregation principle)
* D stands for DIP (Dependency inversion principle)

> There is an excellent video by [Derick  Baily](https://github.com/derickbailey) named [SOLID JavaScript In A Wobbly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAVn7s-kO9o) that provides clear examples of each of these principals applied in JavaScript.

Many people are using these principles in architecture to achieve maintainability and extendability at the architecture level.  Plus this allows the same primary principals to be applied across the entire application from a single module to an enterprise application architecture.
